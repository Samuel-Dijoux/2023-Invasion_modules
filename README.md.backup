## Brief summary of the study

This study investigates the multiple influences of invading species in simple communities (consumer-resource systems) that are subject to environmental gradients (temperatures and nutrient enrichment) and community size structure. We developed biomass-based models of community dynamics to investigate the influences of invader traits (body mass and trophic position) on community changes in composition, diversity and stability regime. We compare four food web modules consisting of three species (apparent and exploitative competition, trophic chain, intraguild predation), thus summarizing all trophic interactions formed between local communities and invading species.

## Layout
The repository is split into two main directories, each containing a descriptive **_README.md_**:
* **code**: all codes used in the study for the analyses, data transformation, and figure illustrations.
* **data**: all data generated and transformed.
